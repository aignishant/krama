# Day 003 — Traffic estimates

## Navigation — where to start

1. **Learn:** read [the topic explanation](CONCEPTS.md) for the intuition, state, and reasoning.
2. **Trace and check readiness:** follow [the worked example](CONCEPTS.md#worked-trace), then answer [the readiness questions](CONCEPTS.md#readiness-before-practice).
3. **Read the assignment:** use [the bounded design task](#assignment) after the explanation.
4. **Write your decision:** use [DESIGN.md](DESIGN.md) for assumptions, the artifact, an alternative, and a failure trace.
5. **Verify:** apply [the acceptance check](#acceptance-check), testing whether the stated user outcome is observable.
6. **Record:** keep actual evidence, uncertainty, and status in [DESIGN.md](DESIGN.md).
7. **Recall later without practice:** read the [system design summary file](../../../docs/SD_RECALL.md#day-003-traffic-estimates) for previously studied topics. Cards appear as days are taught; their presence does not mark study complete.

**Track:** sd. **Budget:** 30 minutes (5 recall + 10 concept/reference + 12 design + 3 critique). **Outcome:** SD-03.
**Weekly theme:** Requirements and estimation.

## Assignment

Assume 1 million daily users and 10 reads per user; calculate average QPS and a separately justified peak multiplier.

## Work method

Produce one bounded artifact: a small diagram, a calculation with units, a state table or a short decision memo. Label assumptions before reasoning from them. Trace one concrete request or failure through the result. Compare at least one alternative and state why your choice fits the requirements.

## Acceptance check

- [ ] Show units, average rate, an explicit peak scenario, and one sensitivity case.
- [ ] I completed the specific assignment above and saved evidence.
- [ ] I can explain the mechanism or tradeoff without reading my notes.
- [ ] I named one failure or counterexample and the response to it.
- [ ] I distinguished an assumption from an observed result.
- [ ] I recorded complete, partial or needs-review in the independent track ledger.

Save the answer in [DESIGN.md](DESIGN.md). Full service implementation is not required.
When the cap is reached, record the next step. Continue this track later without blocking the other two.
