# Day 030 — LeetCode interview practice

Use this inside the existing **60-minute DSA budget**. Choose the online problem or
the local exercise as the main attempt; use its companion as a variation or review.

[Interview method](../../../docs/INTERVIEW_PREP.md) · [Local contract](PRACTICE.md) · [Evidence](NOTES.md)

## 56. Merge Intervals

[Open the official problem](https://leetcode.com/problems/merge-intervals/)

**Difficulty:** Medium. **Original course day:** 30.

**Contract comparison:** Both merge closed intervals, including touching endpoints. Local solve accepts an intervals JSON field and requires sorted output; online uses its judge signature and a nonempty input bound.

## Interview checklist

- [ ] Clarify constraints and explain a baseline before coding.
- [ ] State the invariant or recurrence and why the optimization is valid.
- [ ] Make an independent attempt before hints or an editorial.
- [ ] Test boundary and adversarial cases; record the actual result.
- [ ] Explain time, memory, and one changed-constraint follow-up aloud.
- [ ] Record any hints and a cold re-solve in NOTES.md.

The local `solve(data)` adapter and fixtures do not use the online judge signature.
A local green test is not an online acceptance. Adapt to the official interface when submitting.

[Teaching route](CONCEPTS.md) — includes the mechanism needed for the chosen contract.
